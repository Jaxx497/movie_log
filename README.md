# Movie_Log

### About
This is a personal program I built to help catalogue, document, and organize my digital film collection. The main function of the progam is to collect as much media info as possible on each and every film, including title, year, duration, filesize, resolution, bit depth, audio format & channel count, as well as subtitle format. There's also functionality to connect to a letterboxd account to include personal ratings in the data aggregation. All of the data is output to a csv file, which can be used to build a dataframe, rename & organize directories or manipulate in a multitude of other ways.
