# Movie_Log

### About
This is a personal program I built to help catalogue, document, and organize my digital film collection. The main function of the progam is to collect as much media info as possible on each and every film, including title, year, duration, filesize, resolution, bit depth, audio format & channel count, as well as subtitle format. There's also the ability to connect to a letterboxd account and include personal ratings among the rest of the data. All of the data is output to a csv file, which can be used to build a dataframe or rename & organize directories.
